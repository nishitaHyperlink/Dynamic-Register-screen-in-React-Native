# Dynamic Register Screen :

⭐ my UserDetails component for my React Native app, based on my initial draft:

👉 Form Validation: I will ensure that all required fields (first name, last name, role, email, password) are validated before submission. I will highlight errors clearly to guide the user.

👉 Focus Management: I will use useRef to manage focus between text inputs, improving the user experience.

👉 Conditional Rendering: I will display role picker options only when the input is focused. This will make the form cleaner and more user-friendly.

👉 API Integration: I will handle the API call to save user data efficiently, with proper error handling and user feedback.

👉 Navigation: I will navigate to the next screen only if form validation passes.

👉 Password Visibility: I will provide an option to toggle password visibility to enhance usability.

👉 UI Consistency: I will maintain consistent styling throughout the form to create a seamless user experience.
